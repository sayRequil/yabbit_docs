### Hello
Welcome to Yabbit!  Yabbit is a personalized programming language for any operating system that is still in work in progress.  So strap in and begin the ride!

### What is Yabbit for?
Yabbit is for configurations and more!  It works like INI, and is intended for a custom operating system that we were making but right now works with any operating system.
